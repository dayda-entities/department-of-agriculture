<p>The GCEW herbicide data were collected from 1991-2010, and are documented at plot, field, and watershed scales.</p>
<p>Atrazine concentrations in Goodwater Creek Experimental Watershed (GCEW) were shown to be among the highest of any watershed in the United States based on comparisons using the national Watershed Regressions for Pesticides (WARP) model and by direct comparison with the 112 watersheds used in the development of WARP. This 20-yr-long effort was augmented with a spatially broad effort within the Central Mississippi River Basin encompassing 12 related claypan watersheds in the Salt River Basin, two cave streams on the fringe of the Central Claypan Areas in the Bonne Femme watershed, and 95 streams in northern Missouri and southern Iowa. The research effort on herbicide transport has highlighted the importance of restrictive soil layers with smectitic mineralogy to the risk of transport vulnerability. Near-surface soil features, such as claypans and argillic horizons, result in greater herbicide transport than soils with high saturated hydraulic conductivities and low smectitic clay content.</p>
<p>The data set contains concentration, load, and daily discharge data for Devils Icebox Cave and Hunters Cave from 1999 to 2002. The data are available in Microsoft Excel 2010 format. Sheet 1 (Cave Streams Metadata) contains supporting information regarding the length of record, site locations, parameters measured, parameter units, method detection limits, describes the meaning of zero and blank cells, and briefly describes unit area load computations. Sheet 2 (Devils Icebox Concentration Data) contains concentration data from all samples collected from 1999 to 2002 at the Devils Icebox site for 12 analytes and two computed nutrient parameters. Sheet 3 (Devils Icebox SS Conc Data) contains 15-minute suspended sediment (SS) concentrations estimated from turbidity sensor data for the Devils Icebox site. Sheet 4 (Devils Icebox Load & Discharge Data) contains daily data for discharge, load, and unit area loads for the Devils Icebox site. Sheet 5 (Hunters Cave Concentration Data) contains concentration data from all samples collected from 1999 to 2002 at the Hunters Cave site for 12 analytes and two computed nutrient parameters. Sheet 6 (Hunters Cave SS Conc Data) contains 15-minute SS concentrations estimated from turbidity sensor data for the Hunters Cave site. Sheet 7 (Hunters Cave Load & Discharge Data) contains daily data for discharge, load, and unit area loads for the Hunters Cave site.</p>
