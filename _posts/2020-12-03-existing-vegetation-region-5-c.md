This polygon layer consists of boundaries for the ecological tile units and CALVEG (Classification and Assessment with Landsat of Visible Ecological Groupings) zone units currently being used to tile the EVEG (existing vegetation) dataset. Selected lines were added from the CalWater watershed layer where finer tile divisions were needed. Additionally, attributes from Ecological Units of California (Ecological Domain, Division, Province, Section and Subsection) have been incorporated into this layer. (see Procedures and Citation sections).Â <a href='https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.EV_CalvegZones_Ecoregions.xml' target='_blank'>Metadata</a>
