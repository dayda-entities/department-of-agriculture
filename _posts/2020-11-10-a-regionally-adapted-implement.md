<p>Maize and soybean yield data set for Precision Zonal Management (PZM) project from 2012-2015. Project compared chisel plow tillage against ridge tillage (PZM) systems, with and without winter cereal rye cover crops. Experimental sites in four US states: IL, MI, MN and PA. Data set provides plot-level yield data (kg/ha) for each site-year and for both crops.</p>
<p>File also contains data set of maize and soybean yield stability, with soil properties measured in 2015 (end of experimental period) and delta values (values in 2015 minus values prior to experiment establishment in 2011).</p>
