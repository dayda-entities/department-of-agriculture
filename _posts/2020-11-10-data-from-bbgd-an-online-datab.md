<p>This dataset is supplemental to the article "BBGD: an online database for blueberry genomic data," (2007); it is titled "list of genes printed on microarray slides."</p>
<p>The article, "BBGD: an online database for blueberry genomic data," (2007) involving  blueberry cold hardiness experiments has a list of all the genes that were printed on microarray slides. This dataset, supplemental to the article, is called: "list of genes printed on microarray slides." 1471-2229-7-5-s1.xls 663k.<br />
By using the BBGD database, researchers developed EST-based markers for mapping, and have identified a number of "candidate" cold tolerance genes that are highly expressed in blueberry flower buds after exposure to low temperatures. </p>
<p>BBGD (<a href="http://bioinformatics.towson.edu/BBGD/">http://bioinformatics.towson.edu/BBGD/</a>) is a public online database, and was developed for blueberry genomics. BBGD is both a sequence and gene expression database: it stores both EST and microarray data, and allows scientists to correlate expression profiles with gene function. Presently, the main focus of the database is the identification of genes in blueberry that are significantly induced or suppressed after low temperature exposure.</p>
<p>Data was collected sometime between 2000 and 2007 - exact dates are unknown.</p>
