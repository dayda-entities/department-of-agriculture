The feature class indicates the specific types of motorized vehicles allowed on the designated routes and their seasons of use. The feature class is designed to be consistent with the MVUM (Motor Vehicle Use Map). It is compiled from the GIS Data Dictionary data and Infra tabular data that the administrative units have prepared for the creation of their MVUMs. Only trails with the symbol value of 5-12, 16, 17 are Forest Service System trails and contain data concerning their availability for motorized use. This data is published and refreshed on a unit by unit basis as needed. Individual unit's data must be verified and proved consistent with the published MVUMs prior to publication in the EDW.
