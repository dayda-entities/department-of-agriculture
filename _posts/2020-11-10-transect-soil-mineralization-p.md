<p>Soil mineralization was examined on the control and fertilized treatment transects in association with the vegetation biomass study. Data set contains soil moisture correction factor, sample weight, total inorganic nitrogen (NO3+NO2-N), and nitrogen in ammonium (NH4-N) for Week 0 of nitrogen mineralization potentials.</p>
