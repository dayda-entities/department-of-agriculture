<p>The Delta Neighborhood Physical Activity Study was an observational study designed to assess characteristics of neighborhood built environments associated with physical activity.  It was an ancillary study to the Delta Healthy Sprouts Project and therefore included towns and neighborhoods in which Delta Healthy Sprouts participants resided.  The 12 towns were located in the Lower Mississippi Delta region of Mississippi.  Data were collected via electronic surveys between August 2016 and September 2017 using the Rural Active Living Assessment (RALA) tools and the Community Park Audit Tool (CPAT).  Scale scores for the RALA Programs and Policies Assessment and the Town-Wide Assessment were computed using the scoring algorithms provided for these tools via SAS software programming.  The Street Segment Assessment and CPAT do not have associated scoring algorithms and therefore no scores are provided for them.  Because the towns were not randomly selected and the sample size is small, the data may not be generalizable to all rural towns in the Lower Mississippi Delta region of Mississippi.</p>
<p>Dataset one contains data collected with the RALA Programs and Policies Assessment (PPA) tool.<br />
Dataset two contains data collected with the RALA Town-Wide Assessment (TWA) tool.<br />
Dataset three contains data collected with the RALA Street Segment Assessment (SSA) tool.<br />
Dataset four contains data collected with the Community Park Audit Tool (CPAT).</p>
