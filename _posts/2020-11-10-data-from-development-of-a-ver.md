<p>This data set contains 32 million annotated SNPs having an average SNP density of 30 SNPs per kb and 12 non-synonymous SNPs per gene model. These SNPs were identified from a genetically diverse, worldwide, collection of soybean germplasm representing wild, landrace, and improved cultivars. A combination of new and publicly available re-sequencing data was used in this analysis. The accession genotypes and their annotations are described in the manuscript titled: 'Analysis and characterization of 1500 diverse genome sequences as a versatile resource for post-genomics research'.</p>
