The Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity MTBS project assesses the frequency, extent, and magnitude (size and severity) of all large wildland fires (includes wildfire, wildland fire use, and prescribed fire) in the conterminous United States (CONUS), Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico for the period of 1984 through 2017. All fires reported as greater than 1,000 acres in the western U.S. and greater than 500 acres in the eastern U.S. are mapped across all ownerships. MTBS produces a series of geospatial and tabular data for analysis at a range of spatial, temporal, and thematic scales and are intended to meet a variety of information needs that require consistent data about fire effects through space and time. This map layer is a vector polygon of the location of all currently inventoried and mappable MTBS fires occurring between calendar year 1984 and 2017 for the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. <a href='https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.MTBS_BURN_AREA_BOUNDARY.xml' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>Metadata</a>
