<p>We use vegetation cover as a proxy for plant biomass to avoid confounding spatial and temporal variability or confounding the impact of harvesting. The rate of biomass change is Aboveground net primary production, a key variable that will respond to our PPT and nutrient manipulations. Measured variables: individual cover of plant species measured as cm of green biomass that intercepts a 250cm long line, then averaged for 3 lines/plot.</p>
