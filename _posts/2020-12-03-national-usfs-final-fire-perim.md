The FinalFirePerimeter polygon layer represents final mapped wildland fire perimeters. This feature class is a subset of the FirePerimeters feature class. Incidents of 10 acres or greater in size are expected. Incidents smaller than 10 acres in size may also be included. Data are maintained at the Forest/District level, or their equivalent, to track the area affected by wildland fire. Records in FirePerimeter include perimeters for wildland fires that have corresponding records in FIRESTAT, which is the authoritative data source for all wildland fire reports. FIRESTAT, the Fire Statistics System computer application, required by the USFS for all wildland fire occurrences on National Forest System Lands or National Forest-protected lands, is used to enter and maintain information from the Individual Fire Report (FS-5100-29).<div><br /></div><div><ul>National USFS fire occurrence final fire perimeters where wildland fires have historically occurred on National Forest System Lands and/or where protection is the responsibility of the US Forest Service.
