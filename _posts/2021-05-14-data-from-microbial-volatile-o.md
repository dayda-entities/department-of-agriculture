<p>This dataset is associated with the forthcoming publication entitled, "Microbial volatile organic compounds mediate attraction by a primary but not secondary stored product insect pest in wheat", and includes data on grain damage from near infrared spectroscopy, behavioral data from wind tunnel and release-recapture experiments, as well as volatile characterization of headspace from moldy grain. For all files, incubation intervals 9, 18, and 27 d represent how long grain was incubated after being tempered to a grain moisture of 12, 15, or 19% or left untempered (ctrl; 10.8% grain moisture). TSO = Trece storgard oil; empty = negative control (no stimulus), LGB = lesser grain borer (Rhzyopertha dominica), and RFB = red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum).</p>
