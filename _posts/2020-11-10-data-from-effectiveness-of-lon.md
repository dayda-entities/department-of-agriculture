<p>Response of <em>Tribolium castaneum</em> to exposure to long-lasting insecticide treated netting (LLIN). Includes data on multiple exposures over 5 days and exposures to different biotic and abiotic conditions. Also includes data on movement on the LLIN under different conditions. This was collected to understand cumulative effects of exposure to LLIN and provide information on population recovery parameters in using LLIN as a pest management tactic against stored-product insect pests.</p>
