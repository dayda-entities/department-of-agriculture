<p>For this study, 737 sweetpotato accessions were obtained from the USDA, Agricultural Research Service, <a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/southeast-area/griffin-ga/pgrcu/">PGRCU</a> (Plant Genetic Resources Conservation Unit), Griffin, GA. Each PI was grown in the field in replicated plots at the U. S. Vegetable Laboratory, Charleston, SC. The mature leaves of each PI were evaluated for morphological characters.</p>
