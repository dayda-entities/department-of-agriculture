<p>Unigene sequences were annotated by BlastX alignment to the non-redundant protein database (National Center for Biotechnology Information/GenBank) and the Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus gene annotations (Vectorbase). This was done with a 1e-05 expectation value. Top hits are shown including accession numbers and description, if available. Unigene number and corresponding GenBank accession numbers are provided for all C. sonorensis genes. Both tables are modified from supplementary information tables at <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0098123.s003">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0098123.s003</a> and numbered accordingly.</p>
