<p>The database consists of several sets of data: food descriptions, nutrients, weights and measures, footnotes, and sources of data. The Nutrient Data file contains mean nutrient values per 100 g of the edible portion of food, along with fields to further describe the mean value. Information is provided on household measures for food items. Weights are given for edible material without refuse. Footnotes are provided for a few items where information about food description, weights and measures, or nutrient values could not be accommodated in existing fields.</p>
<p>Data have been compiled from published and unpublished sources. Published data sources include the scientific literature. Unpublished data include those obtained from the food industry, other government agencies, and research conducted under contracts initiated by USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS).</p>
<p>Updated data have been published electronically on the USDA Nutrient Data Laboratory (NDL) web site since 1992. Standard Reference (SR) 27 includes composition data for all the food groups and nutrients published in the 21 volumes of “Agriculture Handbook 8” (US Department of Agriculture 1976-92), and its four supplements (US Department of Agriculture 1990-93), which superseded the 1963 edition (Watt and Merrill, 1963). SR27 supersedes all previous releases, including the printed versions, in the event of any differences.</p>
