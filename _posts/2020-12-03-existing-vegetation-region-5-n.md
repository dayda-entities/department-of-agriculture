<b>Note:</b> <b>This is a large dataset. </b>To download, go to <a href='https://enterprisecontentnew-usfs.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/existing-vegetation-region-5-north-coast-east-feature-layer' target='_blank'>ArcGIS Open Data Set</a> and click the download button, and under additional resources select the geodatabase option. This Existing Vegetation (Eveg) polygon feature class is a CALVEG (Classification and Assessment with LANDSAT of Visible Ecological Groupings) map product from a scale of 1:24,000 to 1:100,000. The geographic extent entails the northeastern portion of CALVEG Zone 1 (North Coast), Ecoregion Section M261A. Source imagery for this layer ranges from the year 1998 to 2015. The CALVEG classification system was used for vegetation typing and crosswalked to other classification systems in this database. USGS Land Use / Land Cover Anderson 1 classification system is included in the database to meet national standard requirements. Mapping standards meet requirements of the USDA Forest Service as defined by the FS GIS data dictionary, FGDC Vegetation standards and the FS Existing Vegetation Classification and Mapping Technical Guide. Regional add-ons are retained for crosswalking to the California Wildlife Habitat Relationship System (CWHR). <a href='https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.EVMid_R05_NorCoastEast.xml' target='_blank'>Metadata</a>
