This Existing Vegetation (Eveg) polygon feature class is a CALVEG (Classification and Assessment with LANDSAT of Visible Ecological Groupings) map product from a scale of 1:24,000 to 1:100,000. The geographic extent entails the middle portion of CALVEG Zone 1 (North Coast), Ecoregion Section M261B. Source imagery for this layer ranges from the year 1998 to 2015. The CALVEG classification system was used for vegetation typing and crosswalked to other classification systems in this database including the California Wildlife Habitat Relationship System (CWHR). <a href='https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.EVMid_R05_NorCoastMid.xml' target='_blank'>Metadata</a>
