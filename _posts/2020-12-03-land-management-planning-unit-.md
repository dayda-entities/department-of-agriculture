The Land Management Planning Unit (LMPU) feature class displays the plan revision status for FS land management planning units, their boundaries, FS Region, planning phase milestone and associated date, and link to a related planning website. A land management plan provides a framework for integrated resource management and for guiding project and activity decision-making on a nationalforest, grassland, prairie, or other administrative unit. New plan development is required for new NFS units; an existing plan may be amended at any time.
