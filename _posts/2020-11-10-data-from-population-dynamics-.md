<p>Datasets archived here consist of all data analyzed in Duan et al. 2015 from Journal of Applied Ecology.   Specifically, these data were collected from annual sampling of emerald ash borer (<em>Agrilus planipennis</em>) immature stages and associated parasitoids on infested ash trees (<em>Fraxinus</em>) in Southern Michigan, where three introduced biological control agents had been released between 2007 - 2010.  Detailed data collection procedures can be found in Duan et al. 2012, 2013, and 2015.</p>
