<p>For this study, 737 sweetpotato accessions were obtained from the USDA, ARS, PGRCU, Griffin, GA.  Each PI was grown in the field in replicated plots at the U. S. Vegetable Laboratory, Charleston, SC.  The mature leaves of each PI was collected and measured using a Konica Minolta Chroma Meter (CR 400).  Data were recorded using CIE 1976 L*a*b* and CIE L*C*h* color spaces.  Data from this study is contained in a manuscript that will be submitted to Genetic Resources and Crop Evolution under the title 'Color Analysis of Sweetpotato Leaves from the USDA, ARS Germplasm Collection.'  Data parameters collected were lightness (L*), red-green coordinate (a*), yellow-blue coordinate (b*), color intensity or chroma (C*), and hue angle (h*).</p>
