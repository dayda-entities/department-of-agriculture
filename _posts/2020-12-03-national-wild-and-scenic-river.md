This polyline feature class depicts the river corridors of each Wild and Scenic River designated by Congress or the Secretary of the Interior for the United States and Puerto Rico. This GIS data layer was created from a mulit-agency effort by the US Forest Service, National Park Service, Bureau of Land Managment, and the US Fish and Wildlife Servce. The spatial data were referenced to the latest High Resolution National Hydrological Data Layer (NHD 1:24,000 Scale or better), published by United States Geological Survey (USGS). <a href='https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.WildScenicRiver_LN.xml' target='_blank'>Metadata</a>
