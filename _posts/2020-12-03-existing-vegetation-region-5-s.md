The geographic extent entails the northeastern portion of CALVEG Zone 7, the South Coast. Source imagery for this layer ranges from the year 2002 to 2010. The CALVEG classification system was used for vegetation typing and crosswalked to other classification systems in this database including the California Wildlife Habitat Relationship System (CWHR). <a href='https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.EVMid_R05_SouCoast.xml' target='_blank'>Metadata</a>
