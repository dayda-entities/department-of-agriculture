This data portrays the FSTopo quad footprint. Quadrangles with a Vintage (greater than zero) make up the FSTopo area of interest.Within the FSTopo database, features are represented as lines, points, or polygons, with descriptive subtype attribute codes attached to describe the cartographic symbology characteristics of features. Annotation features are represented as stand-alone map text collected relative to the scale of the topographic quadrangle. The FSTopo database was originally populated with Cartographic Feature File (CFF) data which was digitized from either the Primary Base Series (PBS) quadrangles or U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic map series quadrangles. Over time, the legacy CFF data is being replaced (at least partially) with data from nationally standardized sources. Data completeness reflects the content of the original source graphic, digital correction guide information, stereoscopic source, monoscopic source, supplemented with cadastral source information. Forests and Quadrangles may have undergone revision at varying dates. The update revision uses a variety of sources, including Digital Orthophoto Quad (DOQ) imagery, NAIP imagery, cadastral information, other vector data sources, and field-prepared correction guides in hardcopy or digital format.
