<p>A panel of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for 363 common bean accessions was generated. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was applied to detect SNPs significantly associated with resistance to Heterodera glycines (HG) also known as the soybean cyst nematode (SCN) in the core collection of common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris. There were 84,416 SNPs identified in 363 common bean accessions.</p>
