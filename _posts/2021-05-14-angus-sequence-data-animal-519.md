<p>Whole genome sequence data for Bovidae Bos taurus - beef Angus. The data is in "fastq" format.</p>
<p>The National Animal Germplasm Program does not have germplasm for this animal.</p>
<p>There are two versions of each file because we did paired end sequencing. There are two reads for each of the 210 data lines (a forward and a reverse read) summing to 420 total. A diagram of this is attached. In the diagram, the two reads would correspond to read 1 and read 3.</p>
