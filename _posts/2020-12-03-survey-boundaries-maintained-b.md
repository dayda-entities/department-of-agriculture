The purpose of this featureclass is to allow national forest system boundary managers to query and report on the status of these boundaries for planning boundary management and maintenance work, and to provide this information to anyone else needing this information for analysis, querying, reporting, mapping. The lines should indicate the current status of the physical marked and posted lines in the field, and their maintenance status. Surface Management Agency (SMA) lines represent the surveyed boundary lines for which the Forest Service is responsible for marking and posting. These include the boundaries between NFS lands and non-NFS lands and the boundaries of congressionally designated areas such as National Wilderness. <a href='https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.SMABoundary.xml' target='_blank'>Metadata</a>
