<p>A systematic search of the literature using Google Scholar, (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/">https://scholar.google.com/</a>) and Web of Science was used to identify studies that examined the effects of individual compounds or mixtures of MVOCs on the behavioral responses of stored-product arthropods. Stored-product arthropods were defined as those insects and arachnids attacking stored, durable commodities in the post-harvest supply chain at any of the successive links, including storage, transportation, processing, and marketing. Where applicable, we parsed studies into component experiments where behavioral responses or other factors such as type of assays or measured variables may have differed (e.g. dosage, compound, etc.). We classified each test as resulting in statistically significant attraction (+), repellence (−), or neither (○) compared to a negative or positive control. We excluded any studies lacking appropriate negative or positive controls, lacking replication, or lacking sufficient details on the identity of tested substrates to enable appropriate interpretation. Terms used to search databases included the following singly and/or in combination: “fungal”, “volatiles”, “stored products”, “insect behavior”, “insect-microbe”, “interactions”, “semiochemicals”, “mycotoxin”, “behavioral response”, “attraction”, and “postharvest”, and combinations thereof. In addition, we kept track of methodology used for tests, response variables, target insect, insect stage, and microbial taxon. We split our analysis up between tests with complex (but usually uncharacterized) blends of MVOCs, and those with known individual or known component mixtures of MVOCs.</p>
