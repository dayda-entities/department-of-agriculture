The FIRESTAT (Fire Statistics System) Fire Occurrence point layer represents ignition points, or points of origin, from which individual wildland fires started on National Forest System lands. The source is the FIRESTAT database, which contains records of fire occurrence, related fire behavior conditions, and the suppression actions taken by management taken from the Individual Wildland Fire Report. This publicly available dataset is updated annually for all years previous to January 1 on or after February 16th.
