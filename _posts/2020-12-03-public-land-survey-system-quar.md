This Quarter Section feature class depicts PLSS Second Divisions . PLSS townships are subdivided in a spatial hierarchy of first, second, and third division. These divisions are typically aliquot parts ranging in size from 640 acres to 160 to 40 acres, and subsequently all the way down to 2.5 acres. The data in this feature class was translated from the PLSSSecondDiv feature class in the original production data model, which defined the second division for a specific parcel of land. <a href='https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.QuarterSection.xml' target='_blank'>Metadata</a>
