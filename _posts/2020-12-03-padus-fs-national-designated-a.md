An area depicting designated land boundaries, excluding boundaries designated by proclamation.Â This data is intended for read-only use. The PAD-US feature classes were developed by the Forest Service for submission to the Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US). It is the official inventory of public parks and other protected open space. With more than 3 billion acres in 150,000 holdings, the spatial data in PAD-US represents public lands held in trust by thousands of national, State and regional/local governments, as well as non-profit conservation organizations. PAD-US is published by the U.S. Geological Survey Gap Analysis Program (GAP). GAP produces data and tools that help meet critical national challenges such as biodiversity, conservation, recreation, public health, climate change adaptation, and infrastructure investment. <a href='https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.PADUS_Designation.xml' target='_blank'>Metadata</a>
