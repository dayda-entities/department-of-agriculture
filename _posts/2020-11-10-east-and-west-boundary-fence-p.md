<p>BACKGROUND. In the spring of 1982, as part of the establishment of the Jornada Long-Term Ecological Research site in southern New Mexico, a 135 ha portion of a 1500 ha, internally drained, watershed was exclosed from grazing by domestic livestock. Prior to exclosure the watershed, as well as the rest of the Jornada basin, had been moderately to heavily grazed for the past 100 years. Concurrent with grazing, the vegetation had undergone a dramatic change from desert grassland, with an almost continuous cover of C4 perennial grasses, to isolated patches of the original grassland in a mosaic with desert shrub dominated plant communities (Buffington and Herbel, 1965). The exclosure lies along a northeast facing piedmont slope at the base of a steep isolated mountain peak, and covers a variety of component landforms from the foot of the mountain to the basin floor. This provided the opportunity to investigate the response of vegetation with respect to landscape characteristics as well as release from grazing. This summary data set consists of percent cover of all perennial plant species from the plant line intercept measurements on either side of the LTER-I exclosure East and West boundary fence. Data is sorted by treatment (grazed, ungrazed), year, fence line, station, then species i.d. Along the East Boundary fence line, the east side is ungrazed (control) and the west side is grazed (treatment). Along the West Boundary fence line, the east side is grazed and the west side is ungrazed. Each plant line transect is divided into 6 5-meter segments. All perennials were measured at about 5 year intervals as the length of intercept for each species along a 30-meter line oriented perpendicular to the fence. Summary data presented in this data set is the average percent cover for the outer-most 2 5-meter segments for the respective treatment (grazed or ungrazed). The term outer-most is relative to the fence. The 5-meter segment on either side of the fence is not included in the cover estimates due to fence line effect disturbances; e.g., cattle trails, tumbleweeds trapped along fence, etc. This summary data does not include the first year of measurement in 1982 because of numerous problems with species codes used that could not resolved.</p>
