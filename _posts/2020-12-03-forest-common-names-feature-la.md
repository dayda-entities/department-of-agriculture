This dataset contains the common names of the national forests and grasslands and their respective FS WWW URL information that is used for both display of the national forest and national grassland boundaries on any map product and for dynamic interactivity of the map. This dataset exhibits the following characteristics: 1. Granularity of the polygon features - The spatial extent of the national forests and the grasslands match the way the agency would like to communicate with the public. 2. Preferred /Common Name of the National Forest Units - The common names of the national forest and grassland match the preferred name column that is present in the common names decision table maintained by the FS Office of Communication. 3. Hyperlinks to FS WWW Home page - This column contains the national forest and their respective FS WWW URL information. This URL could be used on any interactive map applications to link users directly to a forestâ€™s home page. Data Source - This dataset is derived from the following FS ALP (Automated Lands Program) Land Status Records System authoritative data sources: 1. Administrative Forest Boundaries 2. Proclaimed Forest Boundaries 3. Ranger District Boundaries 4. National Grassland Areas. The common names decision table maintained by the FS Office of Communication contains the common name and its respective Land Status Records System authoritative data source to be used for building the spatial polygon. The spatial polygons for every feature in this dataset comes from one or more authoritative data sources listed above. The process to create the common names dataset is reusing the already existing ALP names from the data sources listed above.
