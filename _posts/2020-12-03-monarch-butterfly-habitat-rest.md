Activities meeting the Monarch Butterfly Habitat Restoration initiative are a subset of activities that benefit native plants, and in doing so, benefit pollinators. Activities such as thinning, prescribed fire and other methods of fuel removal, treating invasive species and acres of native plantings can benefit Monarchs. Activities are self-reported by Forest Service Units and are reported when completed. This layer does not contain all activities that benefit Monarchs because this is a relatively new requirement for the program. The quality and comprehensiveness of this data will increase over time.Â <a href='https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.Activity_MBHR_PL.xml' target='_blank'>Metadata</a>
