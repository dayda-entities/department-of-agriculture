<p>The data consists of chemical analyses of dissolved ions in samples of surface runoff from natural rainfall events collected from experimental hydrology plots in creosotebush scrub and grass- land areas of the New Mexico State University Ranch and USDA Jornada Experimental Range. Chemical analyses are for F, Cl, NO3, SO4 by ion chromatography, NH4 by autoanalyzer, Ca, Mg, Na, K by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, and total N and P by auto- analyzer.</p>
