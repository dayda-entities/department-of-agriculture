The Forest Service's Natural Resource Manager (NRM) Forest Activity Tracking System (FACTS) is the agency standard for managing information aboutactivities related to fire/fuels, silviculture, and invasive species. FACTS is an activity tracking application for all levels of the Forest Service. The application allows tracking and monitoring of NEPA decisions as well as the ability to create and manage KV trust fund plans at the timber sale level. This application complements its companion NRM applications, which cover the spectrum of living and non-living natural resource information. This layer represents Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration (CFLR) Program project activities. Also included are other High Priority Restoration projects that are funded outside of CFLR. It is important to note that this layer does not contain all of the approved project activities. Instead, these are the accomplishments that project groups uploaded to the Forest Service corporate data holdings in FACTS. As spatial data is a new requirement for the program, improvements to the quality and comprehensiveness of this data is expected in coming years. <a href='https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.Activity_CFLRP_PT.xml' target='_blank'>Metadata</a>
