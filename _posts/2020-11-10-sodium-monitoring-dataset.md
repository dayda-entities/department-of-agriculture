<p>The Agricultural Research Service of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) in collaboration with other government agencies has a program to track changes in the sodium content of commercially processed and restaurant foods. This monitoring program includes these activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking sodium levels of ~125 popular foods, called "<a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/Docs.htm?docid=22872%20">Sentinel Foods</a>," by periodically sampling them at stores and restaurants around the country, followed by laboratory analyses.</li>
<li>Tracking levels of "related" nutrients that could change when manufacturers reformulate their foods to reduce sodium; these related nutrients are potassium, total and saturated fat, total dietary fiber, and total sugar.</li>
<li>Sharing the results of these monitoring activities to the public periodically in the <a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400525/Sodium/Copy%20of%20SodiumMonitoringDatasetUpdatedJuly2616.xlsx">Sodium Monitoring Dataset</a> and <a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=8964">USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference</a> and once every two years in the <a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=12068">Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Sodium Monitoring Dataset is downloadable in Excel spreadsheet format.</p>
