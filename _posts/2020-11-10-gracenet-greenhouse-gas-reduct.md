<p>GRACEnet (Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network) is a research program initiated in the early 2000s . Goals are to better quantify greenhouse gas GHG emissions from cropped and grazed soils under current management practices and to identify and further develop improved management practices that will enhance carbon (C) sequestration in soils, decrease GHG emissions, promote sustainability and provide a sound scientific basis for carbon credits and GHG trading programs. This program generates information that is needed by agro-ecosystem modelers, producers, program managers and policy makers. Coordinated multi-location field studies follow standardized protocols to compare net GHG emissions (carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane), C sequestration, crop/forge yields, and broad environmental benefits under different management systems that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Typify existing production practices</li>
<li>Maximize C sequestration</li>
<li>Minimize net GHG emissions</li>
<li>Meet sustainable production and broad environmental benefit goals (including C sequestration, net GHG emissions, water, air and soil quality, etc.)</li>
</ol>
