<p>The P Loss in runoff Events from Agricultural fields Database (PLEAD) is a compilation of event-based, field-scale dissolved and/or total P loss runoff loadings from agricultural fields collected at various research sites located in the US Heartland and Southern US. The database also includes runoff and erosion rates; soil test P; tillage practices; planting and harvesting rates and practices; fertilizer application rate, method, and timing; manure application rate, method, and timing; and livestock grazing density and timing. In total, over 1800 individual runoff events – ranging in duration from 0.4 to 97 hr – have been included in the database. Event runoff P losses ranged from less than 0.05 to 1.3 and 3.0 kg P/ha for dissolved and total P, respectively. The data contained in this database have been used in multiple research studies to address important modeling questions relevant to P management planning. We provide these data to encourage additional studies by other researchers.</p>
