This dataset is the official data for the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule (36 CFR 294, Subpart B). It contains the Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRA) that were used in the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule. The IRA data was originally submitted to the Geospatial Service and Technology Center (GSTC - Located in Salt Lake City Utah) by all national forests through their Regional Offices for the Forest Service?s Roadless Area Conservation Initiative. The data was consolidated at the GSTC and used in the Draft Environment Impact Statement. Between the draft and final stages of the Environmental Impact Statement, the data was updated by the forests to reflect any corrections to Inventoried Roadless Areas that were based on existing forest plans and administrative record. The data was also supplemented to include Special Designated Area information and to include Inventoried Roadless Areas within Special Designated Areas. The data was resubmitted to the GSTC on July 21, 2000 for consolidation and the completed coverage was used in the Roadless Area Conservation Final Environmental Impact Statement. IRAs are based on completed forest plans, forest plans in revision where the agency has established an inventory (this information should be available in Appendix C of most forest plans), or other assessments that are completed and adopted by the agency. RARE II (Roadless Area Review and Evaluation of 1977 and 1978) information was used in cases where a forest does not have a more current roadless inventory, which was established using RARE II information. <a href='https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.RoadlessArea_2001.xml' target='_blank'>Metadata</a>
