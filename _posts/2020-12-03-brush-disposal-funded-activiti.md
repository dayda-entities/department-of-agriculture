Depicts the area of activities funded through BDBD and PPPP budget line item and reported through the FACTS database. The objective of the BD Program is to dispose of unwanted slash or other debris created by timber purchaser operations on timber sale contracts, stewardship contracts and permits, not disposed of by the purchaser. Activities are self-reported by Forest Service Units. The Brush Disposal Program (BD) objective of the BD Program was established in 1916. It requires all purchasers of National Forest timber make deposits to the United States for the estimated cost of disposing of brush and other debris resulting from its cutting operations. Brush disposal activities must be consistent with direction established in forest land and resource management plans, identified in environmental documents developed in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA).Â <a href='https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.Activity_BrushDisposal.xml' target='_blank'>Metadata</a>
