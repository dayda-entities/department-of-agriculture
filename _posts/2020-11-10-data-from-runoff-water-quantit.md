<p>Historic data from the Water Resources and Erosion (WRE) watersheds at Grazinglands Research Laboratory (GRL), USDA-ARS, El Reno, OK.  The WRE watersheds are eight 1.6 ha experimental watersheds established and instrumented in 1976 to measure precipitation and surface runoff quantity and quality.  Data was collected from 1977 through 1999 and includes precipitation, runoff, sediment loads, water quality (N, P, suspended sediments), and land management data. These datasets are valuable resources to improve modeling in relation to land use and management changes, climate variability, and other environmental factors and may be useful in developing strategies to mitigate environmental impacts of agricultural systems.</p>
