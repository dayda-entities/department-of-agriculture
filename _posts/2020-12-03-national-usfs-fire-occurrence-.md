The FireOccurrence point layer represents ignition points, or points of origin, from which individual USFS wildland fires started. Data are maintained at the Forest/District level, or their equivalent, to track the occurrence and the origin of individual USFS wildland fires. Forests are working to include historical data, which may be incomplete.<div><br /></div><div><ul>National USFS fire occurrence locations where wildland fires have historically occurred on National Forest System Lands and/or where protection is the responsibility of the US Forest Service. Knowing where wildland fire events have happened in the past is critical to land management efforts in the future.</ul><div><ul>This data is utilized by fire & aviation staffs, land managers, land planners, and resource specialists on and around National Forest System Lands. The attributes included within the FireOccurrence point layer are needed to meet the needs of the US Forest Service, for data exchange between interagency data systems, to relate to the FirePerimeter polygon data layer and various fire data systems, and to track the locations of wildland fires.</ul></div></div>
