This layer includes both Proclaimed Forest and National Grassland boundary areas. A Proclaimed Forest boundary is the boundary encompassing National Forest System land within a national forest that is set aside and reserved from the public domain by executive order or proclamation; congressional action is required to terminate a proclaimed boundary; if, at some point in time, no National Forest System land remains within the proclaimed boundary, then there is no legal significance to the proclaimed boundary, however, its legal status remains. National Grasslands are lands designated "National Grasslands" by the Secretary of Agriculture and permanently held by the Department of Agriculture for administration under Title III of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act.
