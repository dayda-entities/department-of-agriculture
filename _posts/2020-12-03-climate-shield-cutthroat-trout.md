This feature class represents the mid-century (2030-2059) scenario for cutthroat trout, derived from the Climate Shield fish distribution models. These models provide stream-specific probabilistic predictions about the occurrence of juvenile bull trout and cutthroat trout in association with three different scenarios for climate change and brook trout invasions. These datasets indicate all potential cold-water habitats less than 11 degrees Celsius. The attribute fields CT_0BRK - CT_100BRK indicate the probabilities of cutthroat trout occurrence within a cold-water habitat based on the prevalence of brook trout at 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% of the sites within a habitat. The probabilities were predicted using the Climate Shield native trout models developed from known species occurrence in greater than 500 cold-water streams. The stream centerlines were based on the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) but were modified for purposes of modeling and cross-walking to other datasets.
