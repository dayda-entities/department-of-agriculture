This Existing Vegetation (Eveg) polygon feature class is a CALVEG (Classification and Assessment with LANDSAT of Visible Ecological Groupings) map product from a scale of 1:24,000 to 1:100,000 for CALVEG Zone 9, the Great Basin. Source imagery for this layer ranges from the year 1999 to 2009. The CALVEG classification system was used for vegetation typing and crosswalked to other classification systems in this database including the California Wildlife Habitat Relationship System (CWHR). <a href='https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.EVMid_R05_GreatBasin.xml' target='_blank'>Metadata</a>
