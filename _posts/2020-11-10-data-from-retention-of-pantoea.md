<p>Southern green stink bug [<em>Nezara viridula</em> (L.)] adults and other pentatomid pests can transmit pathogens (e.g., the bacterium <em>Pantoea agglomerans</em>) that cause disease in cotton (<em>Gossypium hirsutum</em> L.) and other high-value cash crops worldwide. First instars of <em>N. viridula</em> were recently shown to ingest <em>P. agglomerans</em> strain Sc1R with rifampicin-resistance, and to retain the pathogen to the 2nd instar. The objective of this study was to determine the acquisition of <em>P. agglomerans</em> Sc1R by early instars of <em>N. viridula</em> and determine persistence of <em>P. agglomerans</em> Sc1R across subsequent stadia. In three trials, early instars (1st and 2nd) were exposed to <em>P. agglomerans</em> Sc1R and subsequently maintained to adulthood; cohorts were sampled at 3rd and 5th instars, as well as adults. In every trial, <em>P. agglomerans</em> Sc1R was detected in all stadia, including adults, but significantly higher frequencies of infection than expected were observed at the initial stage of infection (either 1st or 2nd instar). Higher densities of <em>P. agglomerans</em> Sc1R were detected in 1st and 2nd instars, and lower densities were observed in subsequent stadia. Densities of innate bacterial flora were generally lower when the initial stage of exposure was at 1st instar than when the initial stage of exposure was at the 2nd instar. Overall, half of the adults possessed <em>P. agglomerans</em> Sc1R. These findings demonstrated that <em>N. viridula</em> nymphs can acquire <em>P. agglomerans</em> Sc1R and retain the pathogen to adulthood. Potential avenues of research to further elucidate the implications of nymphs harboring pathogens to adulthood are discussed.</p>
