The SilvTSI (Silviculture Timber Stand Improvement) feature class represents activities associated with the following performance measure: Forest Vegetation Improved (Release, Weeding, and Cleaning, Precommercial Thinning, Pruning and Fertilization). The Activities data set portrays the areas where activities are accomplished as a part of the silviculture program of work, funded through the budget allocation process and reported through the Forest Service Activity Tracking System (FACTS) database within the Natural Resource Manager (NRM) suite of applications. The activities are part of the Performance Measures used to rate Agency performance in meeting the Department's Strategic Goals. It is important to note that this layer may not contain all accomplished activities; the spatial portion of the activity description is not currently enforced by FACTS and at this time some are optionally reported by Forest Service units. As spatial data reporting is enforced by the application and acceptance of reporting increases for both tabular and spatial we hope to improve the quality and comprehensiveness of the data used for this layer in coming years.
