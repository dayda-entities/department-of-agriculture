The feature class indicates the specific types of motorized vehicles allowed on the designated routes and their seasons of use. The feature class is designed to be consistent with the MVUM (Motor Vehicle Use Map). It is compiled from the GIS Data Dictionary data and NRM Infra tabular data that the administrative units have prepared for the creation of their MVUMs. Only roads with a SYMBOL attribute value of 1, 2, 3, 4, 11, and 12 are Forest Service System roads and contain data concerning their availability for OHV (Off Highway Vehicle) use. This data is published and refreshed on a unit by unit basis as needed. Data for each individual unit must be verified and proved consistent with the published MVUMs prior to publication.The Forest Service's Natural Resource Manager (NRM) Infrastructure (Infra) is the agency standard for managing and reporting information about inventory of constructed features and land units as well as the permits sold to the general public and to partners. <a href='https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.Road_MVUM.xml' target='_blank'>Metadata</a>
