The RoadlessArea_2001_ID_CO feature class describes the boundaries of all Roadless Areas managed by the US Forest Service. These roadless areas were designated administrative rulemaking to provide management direction for their conservation and managment. The Roadless Area Conservation Rule of 2001 designated roadless areas nationwide. Subsequent rules, the Idaho Roadless Rule of 2008,and the Colorado Roadless Rule of 2012 replaced that direction and designation in the states of Idaho and Colorado. <a href='https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.RoadlessArea_2001_ID_CO.xml' target='_blank'>Metadata</a>
