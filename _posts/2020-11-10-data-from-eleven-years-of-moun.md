<p>Detailed hydrometeorological data from the mountain rain-to-snow transition zone are present for water years 2004 through 2014. The Johnston Draw watershed (1.8 km2), ranging from 1497 â€“ 1869 m in elevation, is a sub-watershed of the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW) in southwestern Idaho. The dataset includes continuous hourly hydrometeorological variables across a 372 m elevation gradient, on north- and south-facing slopes, including air temperature, relative humidity and snow depth from 11 sites in the watershed. Hourly measurements of solar radiation, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and soil moisture and temperature are available at selected stations. The dataset includes hourly stream discharge measured at the watershed outlet. These data provide the scientific community with a unique dataset useful for forcing and validating models in interdisciplinary studies and will allow for better representation and understanding of the complex processes that occur in the rain-to-snow transition zone.</p>
<p>This version of the data set fixes errors in all data files and supersedes the earlier datasets <a href="https://doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/1258769">https://doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/1258769</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/1245163">https://doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/1245163</a>.</p>
