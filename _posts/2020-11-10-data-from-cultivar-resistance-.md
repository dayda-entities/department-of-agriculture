<p>All data from the paper "Cultivar resistance to common scab disease of potato is dependent on the pathogen species." Three separate datasets are included:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A csv file with the disease severity of three common scab pathogens across 55 different potato cultivars in a greenhouse pot assay (Figures 2-5 in the associated paper). The included R script was used with this data to perform the ANOVA for the data from the greenhouse pot assay (Table 2 in the associated paper). This script can be used in R for any similar dataset to calculate the significance and percent of total variation for any number of user-defined fixed effects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A zipped file with all of the qPCR data for the expression of the txtAB genes (Figure 6 in the associated paper).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An Excel file with the HPLC data for making the thaxtomin detection standard curve and quantifying the amount of thaxtomin in the test sample.</p>
</li>
</ol>
