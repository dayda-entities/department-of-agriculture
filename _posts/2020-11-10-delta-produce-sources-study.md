<p>The Delta Produce Sources Study was an observational study designed to measure and compare food environments of farmers markets (n=3) and grocery stores (n=12) in 5 rural towns located in the Lower Mississippi Delta region of Mississippi. Data were collected via electronic surveys from June 2019 to March 2020 using a modified version of the Nutrition Environment Measures Survey (NEMS) Farmers Market Audit tool. The tool was modified to collect information pertaining to source of fresh produce and also for use with both farmers markets and grocery stores.  Availability, source, quality, and price information were collected and compared between farmers markets and grocery stores for 13 fresh fruits and 32 fresh vegetables via SAS software programming.  Because the towns were not randomly selected and the sample sizes are relatively small, the data may not be generalizable to all rural towns in the Lower Mississippi Delta region of Mississippi.</p>
