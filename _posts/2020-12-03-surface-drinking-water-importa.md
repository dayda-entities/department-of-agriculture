<b>Note:</b> <b>This is a large dataset.</b> To download, go to <a href='https://enterprisecontentnew-usfs.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/surface-drinking-water-importance-feature-layer' target='_blank'>ArcGIS Open Data Set</a> and click the download button, and under additional resources select the shapefile or geodatabase option. This dataset provides a watershed index of surface drinking water importance, a watershed index of forest importance to surface drinking water, and a watershed index to highlight the extent to which development, fire, and insects and disease threaten forests important for surface drinking water. This tabular dataset is meant to be joined with the NRCS Watershed Boundary Dataset HUC-12. <a href='https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.ForestsToFaucets.xml' target='_blank'>Metadata</a>
