This dataset includes polygons with a minimum of 40 acres of woodlands per square mile as depicted in William H. Brewerâ€™s 1873 map of woodland density and covers the conterminous United States. Each polygon has been labeled with the density category (1-5) depicted on the original map. This dataset was created by georeferencing a scanned version of the source map and by heads-up digitizing each woodland density polygon.
