<p>This dataset links to a data download from the Daymet website. Data parameters are Latitude: 34.2547 Longitude: -89.8735 X & Y on Lambert Conformal Conic: 897941.75 -822030.73; Tile: 11206; Elevation: 91 meters; Years: 1980-2014. Archived and distributed through the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center (ORNL DAAC), the Daymet dataset for Goodwin Creek provides gridded estimates of daily weather parameters for North America, including daily continuous surfaces of minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation occurrence and amount, humidity, shortwave radiation, snow water equivalent, and day length. The Goodwin Creek site is located in the Bluff Hills, just east of the Mississippi River valley. In addition to being a core AmeriFlux site, Goodwin Creek is affiliated with a multitude of other projects including Surface Radiation (SURFRAD), Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN), and is one of twelve USDA Conservation Reserve Program watersheds. Natural disturbances are of minimal influence to the site. The immediate region is primarily used for grazing while infrequent logging activities occur in nearby forests. The grass surrounding the base of the tower is mowed periodically to maintain a height consistent with the regional grasslands.<br />
               Daymet is supported by funding from NASA through the Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) and the Terrestrial Ecosystem Program. The continued development of the Daymet algorithm and processing is also supported by the Office of Biological and Environmental Research within the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science.</p>
