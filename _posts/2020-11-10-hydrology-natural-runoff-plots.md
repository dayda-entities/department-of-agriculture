<p>OVERVIEW This is the Jornada Long Term Ecological Research site data base for the 2 x 2 meter natural rainfall-runoff plots. There are 4074 plot-events or observations in the data set. Of those 4074 observations, 2745 contained precipitation values greater than zero or contained precipitation values greater than runoff values. Very few observations showed runoff values greater than precipitation. All values are included here for completeness of the data set. These data were collected and analyzed in the laboratory under the supervision of John Anderson (primarily). Dr. Susan M. Bolton and Dr. Tim J. Ward compiled and checked the data. Tim J. Ward is responsible for the final input, checking and presentation of the data set presented below. Questions about the data should be directed to Tim J. Ward through the Jornada LTER.</p>
