Site identification follows: ZONE C - creosotebush; G - grassland SITE CALI-HYD Caliche site - Hydrology study TERM-HYD Termite +/- site - Hydrology study IBPE-HYD IBPE site - Hydrology study SUMM-HYD Summerford site - Hydrology study PLOT CALI-HYD, IBPE-HYD, & SUMM-HYD each have 4 run off plots numbered 1-4. TERM-HYD has 8 plots; 4 control (C1-C4) and 4 treatment (T2-T5). Treatment was with Chlordane to eliminate termites in soil.</p>
