<p>The Agricultural Collaborative Research Outcomes System (AgCROS) is a growing “network of networks” that presently consists of multiple agricultural data networks: Nutrient Uptake and Outcome Network (NUOnet), the Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement Network (GRACEnet), Resilient Economic Agricultural Practices (REAP), Dairy Agriculture for People and the Planet (DAPP; Dairy Grand Challenge), Soil Health Assessment Network (SHAnet), Agricultural Antibiotic Resistance (AgAR), and the Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) Network. By integrating these diverse database networks, AgCROS facilitates the flow of information and increases the cooperation among researchers participating in these networks.</p>
