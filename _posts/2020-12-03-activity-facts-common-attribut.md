Note: This is a large dataset. Download of the full dataset is not available. To download FACTS activities layers, search for the activity types you want, such as timber harvest or hazardous fuels treatments. The Forest Service's Natural Resource Manager (NRM) Forest Activity Tracking System (FACTS) is the agency standard for managing information about activities related to fire/fuels, silviculture, and invasive species. This feature class contains the FACTS attributes most commonly needed to describe FACTS activities.
