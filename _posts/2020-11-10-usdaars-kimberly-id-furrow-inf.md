<p>The data are derived from the  field monitoring of irrigated furrows from 1998 to 2016 at the research farm of the USDA/ARS-Northwest Irrigation and Water Research Laboratory in Kimberly, Idaho, USA (south-central Idaho).  For each monitored furrow, irrigation inflow rates, outflow rates, and sediment concentrations were recorded periodically during the irrigation.  A gated pipe conveyed irrigation water across the plots at the head, or inflow-end, of the furrows and adjustable spigots supplied water to each irrigated furrow.  The methodology used to obtain the field data is described by Lentz and Sojka (2009).  Inflows were measured by timing the filling rate of a known volume, and runoff were measured with long-throated, v-notch flumes. Outflows were measured and runoff samples collected at 30 min intervals during the first 1-3 hr of an irrigation, and every hour or two for the next 3 to 5 hr.  If the set was continued for an additional 12 hr, two to four additional measurements were made.  Immediately after each flume reading, sediment concentration in furrow streams were measured by collecting one-liter runoff samples from free-flowing flume discharge.  The weight of sediment per liter of runoff was determined from the settled volume of sediment using the Imhoff-cone technique.  Three Imhoff-cone sediment samples were collected from each treatment in each irrigation.  These were filtered, and the papers dried and weighed.  A calibration function relating the 30-min, settled-sediment volume to sediment mass-per-unit-volume of runoff was then calculated and used to convert settled sediment volume in cones to sediment mass.</p>
<p>The field data for each study or year were analyzed using the WASHOUT program (Lentz and Sojka, 1995).  The WASHOUT program produces an output file (filename.out), which become components of this Ag Data Commons data set.</p>
<p>For many years and irrigations, furrows were monitored at one or more locations along the furrow, as well as at the end (bottom) of the furrow.  In these cases, data for each position within the furrow are listed in the data set, labelled for example as 'Top', 'Middle', and 'Bottom' (See Data Dictionary tab).  For each furrow position the data represent the flow, infiltration, and runoff information for the length of furrow, which begins at its inflow end (top of the field) and ends at the defined furrow position.  This distance is listed in the field data file for each furrow and irrigation.</p>
<p>An Irrigation Data Summary is included as a tab in the data set spreadsheet.  This is a summary list of the studies and irrigations that are included in the data set.  Also included is a PAM-Application-Codes tab that lists description of the polyacrylamide (PAM) treatments that were employed in some of the included studies.</p>
