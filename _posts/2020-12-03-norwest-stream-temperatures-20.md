This layer represents modeled stream temperatures derived from the 
NorWeST point feature class (NorWest_TemperaturePoints). NorWeST summer 
stream temperature scenarios were developed for all rivers and streams 
in the western U.S. from the &gt; 20,000 stream sites in the NorWeST 
database where mean August stream temperatures were recorded. The 
resulting dataset includes stream lines (NorWeST_PredictedStreams) and 
associated mid-points NorWest_TemperaturePoints) representing 1 
kilometer intervals along the stream network. Stream lines were derived 
from the 1:100,000 scale NHDPlus dataset (USEPA and USGS 2010; McKay et 
al. 2012). Shapefile extents correspond to NorWeST processing units, 
which generally relate to 6 digit (3rd code) hydrologic unit codes 
(HUCs) or in some instances closely correspond to state borders. The 
line and point shapefiles contain identical modeled stream temperature 
results. The two feature classes are meant to complement one another for
 use in different applications. In addition, spatial and temporal 
covariates used to generate the modeled temperatures are included in the
 attribute tables at 
https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/boise/AWAE/projects/NorWeST/ModeledStreamTemperatureScenarioMaps.shtml.
 The NorWeST NHDPlusV1 processing units include: Salmon, Clearwater, 
Spokoot, Missouri Headwaters, Snake-Bear, MidSnake, MidColumbia, Oregon 
Coast, South-Central Oregon, Upper Columbia-Yakima, Washington Coast, 
Upper Yellowstone-Bighorn, Upper Missouri-Marias, and Upper Green-North 
Platte. The NorWeST NHDPlusV2 processing units include: Lahontan Basin, 
Northern California-Coastal Klamath, Utah, Coastal California, Central 
California, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and Black Hills.
