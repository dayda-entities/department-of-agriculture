<p>The soybean aphid, <em>Aphis glycines</em> Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is native to Asia where it is an occasional pest of soybean, <em>Glycine max</em> (L.). <em>Aphis glycines</em> was found during 2000 in North America and since then has spread throughout much of the area where soybean is grown. In Asia, <em>A. glycines</em> seldom reaches damaging levels; however in North America, it has become the most important insect pest of soybean, decreasing yields and incurring large control costs. Field surveys and exclosure experiments in China showed that natural enemies can limit soybean aphid abundance. A project to find, evaluate, and introduce Asian natural enemies into North America was initiated in 2001, with an emphasis on parasitoids. To ensure that introductions of exotic parasitoids would have minimum impact on non-target species, we tested host specificity of all candidates for introduction. These data sets provide results of no-choice laboratory experiments on host specificity of 13 populations in seven species from three species complexes in the genus <em>Aphelinus</em> (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae). They also provide results of experiments on the mechanisms of host specificity in three parasitoid species with narrow host ranges.</p>
