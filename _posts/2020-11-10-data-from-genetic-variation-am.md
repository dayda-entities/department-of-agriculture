<p>This data is from the manuscript titled: "Genetic variation among 481 diverse soybean accessions, inferred from genomic re-sequencing". SNP calls were obtained from resequencing 481 diverse soybean lines comprising 52 wild (<em>Glycine soja</em>) and 429 cultivated (<em>Glycine max</em>).  This dataset contains 6 gzipped VCF (Variant Call Format) files with variant calls for all 481 USB accessions, all <em>G. max</em> accessions, <em>G. soja</em> accessions, accessions sequenced at 15x coverage, accessions sequenced at 40x coverage, and 106 accessions re-sequenced from a previous study (Valliyodan et al. 2016). SNPs were called using the Haplotype caller algorithm from the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) version gatk-2.5-2-gf57256b. A total of 7.8 million SNPs were identified between the 481 re-sequenced accessions. SNPs were assigned IDs using the script "assign_name.awk" available at <a href="https://github.com/soybase/SoySNP-Names">https://github.com/soybase/SoySNP-Names</a>. SNP effects were predicted using SnpEff 3.0.</p>
